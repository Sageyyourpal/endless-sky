I hear the drums echoing tonight
but she only hears whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"HURRY BOY, IT'S WAITING THERE FOR YOU"
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM YOU
THERES NOTHING THAT A HUNDRED MEN OR MORE COULD EVER DO
I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA
GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THE THINGS WE NEVER HAD
The wilds wild dogs cry out in the night
as they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do whats right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serangeti
I seek to cure whats deep inside
Frightened of this thing that Ive become
ITS GONNA TAKE A LOT TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM YOU
THERE'S NOTHING THAT A HUNDRED MEN OR MORE COULD EVER DO
I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA
GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THE THINGS WE NEVER HAD
"HURRY BOY SHE'S WAITING THERE FOR YOU"
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM YOU
THERES NOTHING A HUNDRED MEN OR MORE COULD EVER DO
I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA
I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA (I BLESS THE RAIN)
I BLESS THE RAIN DOWN IN AFRICA (I BLESS THE RAIN)
I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
